gtd-poc is a prototype for a web based implementation of the Getting Things Done paradigm.

The goals of this preliminary implementation are:

	- highest priority on usability and speed, thus using client side scripting
	- implement as fast as possible, even at the expense of code quality
	- determine a suitable data model
	- develop and determine typical use cases

Since this is a pure proof of concept, no priority is given to:

	- clean code
	- documentation
	- authentication and multi user support (HTTP auth for now)
	- cosmetic interface design
	- browser compatibility

A proper reimplementation (not necessarily using the same languages/libraries) is certain to follow if the concept turns out to be actually used by the author(s).
